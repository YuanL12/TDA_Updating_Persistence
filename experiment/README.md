# Experiemnt Results 
All csv files are stored in `experiment/csv_record`. The first row is the header and spererated by comma. 

### To Read and do statistics analysis
You can read them by Pandas easily, as shown in 
`experiment/csv_record/Statistics on csv with pandas.ipynb`. 


### To write in to csv file
If you want to perform more experiments, and add them as the same format in the existing csv file, simply try different sizes on the python script in the two folders: 
`experiment/bats/` and 
`experiment/comparison/`. Then the resulst will append in the end of existing csv files.
